# Discriminant Analysis
## Goal
1. To describe, either graphically or algebraically, the differential features of objects from several unknown populations.
We try to find "discriminants whose numerical values are such that the populations are seperated as much as possible.

2. To sort observations into two or more labeled classes.

## Gaussian Assumption
Knowing true pdf is impossible, we assume the populations folllow multivariate normal.  
$X_1 \sim N_p(\mu_1, \Sigma_1 \\ 
X_2 \sim N_p(\mu_2, \Sigma_2$
